# Floquet_Analysis_HO_and_TLS_models
The project provides full Hamiltonian system of HO and TLS models eigenenergies calculation with non-rotating wave approximation (non-RWA), as well as non-perturbative and perturbative effects on the interaction Hamiltonian

Both models provide the calculation of quasienergies as function of coupling strength ($g_{12}$), oscillating amplitude and driving frequency. 

TLS model: two coupled two-level systems with and without mechanical effect on interaction Hamtiltonian.

HO model: two coupled Harmonic Oscilators model with and without mechanical effect on interaction Hamiltonian.
