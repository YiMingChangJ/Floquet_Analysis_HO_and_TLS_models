The Floquet states analysis

In this section, we discuss a method that allows one to obtain analytical solutions to periodic linear differential equations, specifically, using Floquet theory of quantum mechanical systems with a time-periodic Hamiltonian. This will allow us to solve for the quasi-energy levels in the presence of a periodic dipole term described from dipole spatial oscillation, 


$\mathbf{R}_1(t) = \alpha_m\sin(\omega_m t+\phi_m)\mathbf{x}+x_0\mathbf{x}$.

Floquet engineering is a powerful tool in analysing periodic system and also provides an intuitive understanding of time-driven system. One of the major strengths of Floquet theory, is that we can translate any periodic time-dependent Hamiltonian into an effective time-independent Hamiltonian represented by an infinity matrix. 

We used coupled TLSs with real-time mechanical oscillations to predict and interpret our numerical results, generate by PyCharge.
